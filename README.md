**Static recompilation of NES games to native code without Visual Studio!**

This is a fork of [NESRecomp](https://github.com/mstan/nesrecomp), adapted for building with **MinGW-w64** and **Makefile**.

> **All adaptation work was done in dialogue with Claude AI (Anthropic).**
> The code is completely open source. Doesn't require Visual Studio.
